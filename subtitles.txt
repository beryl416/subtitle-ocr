[01:18:29] yam Just a moment ago, | made some pretty big claims by saying that
[01:18:31] Claude was an expert at making use of tools. And
[01:18:34] that Claude code was easily extensible. Naturally,
[01:18:37] you might be a little skeptical, so I'd like to give you a few
[01:18:39] quick demonstrations. On this table are the
[01:18:42] default tools that are available in Claude code. It
[01:18:44] has all the abilities you would expect, like reading files,
[01:18:47] writing files, running commands, and so on. |'m
[01:18:50] going to show you a couple of tasks completed using
[01:18:52] Claude Code. And in each case, it will use
[01:18:55] this set of tools in rather intelligent ways. And
[01:18:58] in at least one task, I'll even give Claude an
[01:19:00] additional new set of tools to make use of.
[01:19:03] Not only will this process give you a good idea of what Claude
[01:19:06] code can do right out of the box, but hopefully
[01:19:09] you will also see how easily you can extend Claude
[01:19:12] code with more functionality. Here's my
[01:19:14] first task for Claude code. I'm going to ask it to fincjeamae
[01:19:17] land optimize performance issues in the chalk library.gaama

[01:20:05] So I'm going to ask Claude to run the benchmarks, identify
[01:20:08] the worst performing cases, use some profiling tools
[01:20:11] to figure out why those cases are running so slowly, and then
[01:20:13] fix them. We'll then see that Claude is going to use a wide
[01:20:16] variety of different tools to intelligently tackle this problem. : :
[01:20:20] It'll form up a 2DList to track its progress,

[01:20:38] in one particular operation around this library. Here's
[01:20:41] another example of how well Claude can string together different
[01:20:44] tool calls to complete a rather complex task. |'m
[01:20:46] going to give it a data set inside the CSV file. All
[01:20:49] the data inside of here contains information about different users
[01:20:52] of a video streaming platform. And I'm going to ask it to
[01:20:54] just do a general analysis, maybe identify some causes
[01:20:57] of churn on the platform. And | want all this analysis|
[01:21:00] to be done inside of a Jupyter notebook. Here's
[01:21:03] my data set. I'm then going to ask Claude to run
[01:21:06] wer orgie ey the analysis and let's see how it does. This is
[01:21:09] mas a great example of where effective tool use is really
[01:21:11] important. You see, it's not really enough that

[01:21:31] up, I'd like to show you an example of a task where | extend Claude
[01:21:34] Code's capabilities by giving it access to a new set
[01:21:37] of tools. | built a small app that will
[01:21:39] generate Ul components based upon some description entered
[01:21:42] ion the left side of the screen. The generated component
[01:21:45] is then displayed on the right side. Now, the app can
[01:21:48] generate good looking components quite easily, but
[01:21:50] the chat interface on the left and the header at the top}
[01:21:53] are not looking so nice. So
[01:21:56] I'm going to use Claude Code to improve the styling. If
[01:21:59] | just asked it to fix the styling and the chat interface in the
[01:22:01] header, it would likely do a fine job. But remember,
[01:22:04] my goal here is to show you how easy it is to}
[01:22:07] add additional functionality to Claude Code. So along
[01:22:09] with this styling task, I'm going to also give Claude Code
[01:22:12] access to a new set of tools provided by
[01:22:15] something called the Playwright MCP server, which
[01:22:17] I'll tell you more about later on. These tools allow
[01:22:20] Claude to directly open and control a browser.
[01:22:24] So here's what that process looks like in action. I'm
[01:22:26] going to ask Claude to improve the styling of my app and moka
[01:22:29] use of a browser to do so. It'll then oC)

[01:22:49] «before long, we've got something that actually looks pretty reasonable J
[01:22:53] There's one last set of demonstrations that | like to give you. Remember,
[01:22:56] what | mentioned a moment ago. Claude's ability to
[01:22:58] utilize tools so well is what will allow Claude code
[01:23:01] to grow with you and your team in the future. Let
[01:23:04] me show you an example of that right away. Claude has
[01:23:07] a very close integration with GitHub. You can set up Claude’
[01:23:10] code to run inside of a GitHub action,
[01:23:12] where it will be executed automatically based upon certain
[01:23:15] events, like creating a pull request or,
[01:23:18] when directly mentioned inside an issue. When
[01:23:20] Claude Code runs on GitHub, it not only gets
[01:23:23] to view and run your code, but it also
[01:23:26] gets to access a new Set of tools for interacting
[01:23:28] with GitHub, like the ability to create comments}
[01:23:31] or create commits or pull requests and so on. You
[01:23:34] can use this integration to automatically review pull
[01:23:37] requests. Let me show you an example. Let me first
[01:23:40] set up a little scenario for you. Let's imagine that we are
[01:23:42] building out some infrastructure on AWS, and all
[01:23:45] lof our infrastructure is to find inside of a set of terraform
[01:23:48] files, which are committed and stored on GitHub.
[01:23:51] Because all of our infrastructure is to find inside of terraform
[01:23:54] files, Claude Code has a really good idea of how
[01:23:56] information is flowing through our infrastructure.
[01:23:59] And let's imagine that in the SAP, | have a DynamoDB
[01:24:02] table. If you're not familiar with those, it's kind of like a normal database
[01:24:05] table. Inside there, I'm storing some different information
[01:24:08] about users, including maybe plans viewed and
[01:24:11] a registration date. And for maybe some
[01:24:13] reason, we want to share just that plans viewed and
[01:24:16] registration date information with some internal
[01:24:19] marketing team, but also some external
[01:24:22] marketing team as well. So some other company has
[01:24:25] access to the data that we are writing in this bucket.
[01:24:27] So it's really important for us to always be aware of what information
[01:24:30] is being written into that bucket over time. Nightly,
[01:24:34] we might have a Lambda function, pull out all the different users
[01:24:37] that have been added into that table, and then extract just
[01:24:40] plans for you and the registration date, and store
[01:24:43] that in the S3 bucket so these two marketing teams
[01:24:45] can access that information. Now let's
[01:24:48] imagine that months later on, the internal
[01:24:51] marketing team asks us to also store the email
[01:24:54] inside of this S3 bucket as well. So we might
[01:24:56] go into the Lambda function and add in just one single line
[01:24:59] of code that takes the user's email and stores it inside
[01:25:02] the bucket. And because this is months later on,
[01:25:05] we might have completely forgotten that this S3 bucket
[01:25:08] is shared with a external marketing partner. So
[01:25:10] now at this point in time, we are putting personally identifiable
[01:25:13] information into this bucket, which is accessible}
[01:25:16] in the bucket
[01:25:16] by a separate company. This is a big no-no. Definitely
[01:25:19] something we would not want to do. But at the same time, this
[01:25:22] is an error that does occur, and it's kind
[01:25:25] lof hard to catch if we don't have a good idea of exactly
[01:25:27] what's going on with this S3 bucket. Well,
[01:25:30] it turns out that Claude Code can catch this kind
[01:25:33] lof scenario inside of a pull request quite easily,
[01:25:35] specifically because all of our infrastructure is defined inside
[01:25:38] lof those terraform files. So here's a quick example.
